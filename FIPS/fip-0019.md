## Simple Summary

A one-message protocol for updating any sector with new data without re-sealing.

## Abstract

Storage provider embeds deal data into existing sector replica with some unpredictable randomness by "xor"-ing.

The miner generates one message which proves that sector was updated with new data.

## Change Motivation

Since 90+% of sectors in the Filecoin Network are CC sectors, having a protocol that allows for updating CC sectors to store real data without incurring in a full re-sealing would massively improve our network in terms of the amount of real data stored through it. 

1. It would allow **decoupling sealing latency from deal-making speed** - offering storage clients an improved experience for how quickly their data can land in on-chain deals
2. It would **unlock the 8EiB of storage already committed to the Filecoin network** to be quickly used for deals - enabling a 100PiB+ client to make deals for their entire dataset with a single miner like [f0127595](https://filfox.info/en/address/f0127595) which already has 120PiB of committed capacity.
3. It makes **utilizing existing committed capacity much cheaper for miners** (since theyâ€™ve already invested the sealing cost), increasing the chances they pay clients to add FIL+ data to these sectors.

What this FIP does not support (see Future Work section):
* Deal updates
* Moving deals across sectors

## Specification

### Nomenclature
**SectorKeyCID** - on-chain commitment of CC sector replica

**UnsealedSectorCID** - commitment of deal data generated from PieceCIDs

**SealedSectorCID** - commitment of sector replica with deals embedded in it

**EncodingRands** - collection of **HashShards** randomness values used for encoding process

**Poseidon-128** - SNARK friendly hash function


### Parameters

**ChallengesNumber** = 1376 - number of challenges to be proven

**HashShards** = 512 - number of hashes used for randomness in encoding process


### One-messages Update Protocol
1. **Miner accepts and publishes storage deals (using PublishStorageDeals)**
2. **Miner updates an existing replica with deals**:
	1. Pre-generate HashShards possible number of `EncodingRand(ComputeUnsealedCID(P1, P2, P3, ...), i)`
	where `P1, P2, P3, ...` are pieces corresponding to deals that will included in this sector.
	2. Encode the deal data into existing replica using `newReplica[i] = Enc(sectorKey[i], data[i], EncodingRand(o))` function:
		- `newReplica` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the new replica
		- `sectorKey` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the CC sector replica data
		- `data` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the deals data ordered and padded as done in the sealing subroutine
		- `NodeSectorSize` is size of the sector in nodes (32 byte chunks)
	3. Compute SealedSectorCID of the `newReplica`.
3. **Miner produces a proof of sector update.**
	Generate a SNARK that proves:
	1. Generation of ChallengesNumber challenges in batches of 8:
		1. For `j=0..ChallengesNumber//8`, `[_, c[8*j+7], c[8*j+6], ..., , c[8*j] = Split-31bit(Poseidon-128(Poseidon-128(UnsealedSectorCID, SealedSectorCID), j)`.
		The `Split-31bit` splits the 255bit output of Poseidon-128 hash into 8 31 bit chunks and discards 7 high bits.
		2. `c[i] = c[i] mod NodeSectorSize`
	2. For each challenge `i=0..ChallengesNumber`,  `c = c[i]`
		1. Encoding: the following we correcty computed: `newReplica[c] = Enc(sectorKey[c], data[c], Poseidon-128(UnsealedSectorCID, c*HashNumber//NodeSectorSize)`
		2. Inclusion proofs:
			1. `newReplica[c]` is the opening of `UpdatingSectorCID` at position `c`
			2. `sectorKey[c]` is the opening of `CommRLast` from `SealedSectorCID` at position `c`
			3. `data[c]` is the opening of `UnsealedSectorCID` at position `c`

4. **Miner publishes `Miner.ReplicaUpdate(SectorID, NewSealedSectorCID, deals []DealID, Proof)`**:
	1. Verify the proof of correct data update:
		1. Check that `SectorID` was originally CC sector, and fetch `SectorKey` or if that is null use `SealedSectorCID`.
		2. Check that `SectorID` has no deals active that are not included in the `deals` param.
		3. Check that all `deals` are either already in `SectorID` or are to be activated.
		3. Compute `NewUnsealedSectorCID` (CommD) based on DealIDs and deal table.
		6. Verify that `proof` is valid for using inputs: `NewSealedSectorCID`, `NewUnsealedSectorCID`, `SectorKey`.
	2. Activate new deals in `deals` array.
	3. If `SectorKeyCID` is null, set it to `SealedSectorCID`
	4. Update `SealedSectorCID` to `NewSealedSectorCID`
	5. Update `UnsealedSectorCID` to `NewUnsealedSectorCID`


### Algorithms


#### Encoding Randomness

`EncodingRand(UnsealedSectorCID, i) = Poseidon-128(UnsealedSectorCID, i*HashShards//NodeSectorSize)`

Intuitively the sector nodes (32byte chunks) are split into **HashShards** number of continuous segments with
the same encoding randomness.

#### Encoding

The current encoding algorithm is the following:

`Enc(sectorKey[i], data[i]) = sectorKey[i] + data[i] * EncodingRand(i)`

The Encoding function is cheap and allows for parallel encoding. 

#### Decoding

`Dec(sectorKey[i], replica[i]) = (replica[i] - sectorKey[i]) * (EncodingRand(i)<sup>-1</sup>)`

The modular inverse of `EncodingRand` can be computed only **HashShards** times per whole operation.

### Retrieving updated data from encoded replica

1. From the `replica`:
   2. Regenerate `sectorKey` by re-sealing the sector
   3. For each `i`: `Dec(sectorKey[i], replica[i], EncodingRand)`

## Design Rationale

### Encoding Function

The aim of the encoding function is to allow encoding data into an existing sector key without breaking
the compressibility assumption of PoRep.
...

### Parameters choice

* `ChallengeNumber`: 1376 - to facilitate required security factor with Fiat-Shamir (TODO expand in Security Considerations).
* `HashShards`: 512 - to reach required spacegap fraction without neadlessly increasing the cost of conducting protocol (TODO explanation).

### Limitations

The update protocol is limited to CC sectors as the `SectorKey` commitment is only avaliable for sectors with no data. The SectorKey commitment is currently included as `CommRLast` commitment inside the on-chain `SealedSectorCID`  when the sector is CC. When the sector contains deals natively the `SealedSectorCID` includes only `CommRLast+Data` commitment.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is not backwards compatible and will require a new actors version and a network upgrade.

## Test Cases

TODO

## Security Considerations

### Loosing epsilon-Replication guarantees

This changes changes the security property of Filecoin. Retrievability of the files and space-hardness are still guaranteed. TODO: expand on this.

### Poseidon-128

Poseidon-128 is zk-SNARK friendly hash function which is already widely used in Filecoin protocol.
Both uses of Poseidon-128 include Domain Separation Tags such that the usage here does not clash with possible future use cases.

Domain Separation Tags used:
 - Encoding Randomness Generation: `XXXX`
 - Challenge Generation: `XXXX`

## Incentive Considerations

SnapDeals does not allow miners to release currently held collateral for the sector but it allows
to reuse that already held collateral if collateral required is greater, for example due to verified deal.

## Product Considerations

Snap Deals protocol significantly reduces the time needed for data to be included in a sector
and confirmed on-chian. The process was designed with cost for storage providers in mind.

## Implementation

- TODO: Initial Pledge should be updated in one of the new methods, we believe it should be PreCommit.
- TODO: How do we best represent deals in Declare update? Do we relist all the deals or we show a diff of deals?

## Future work

* DeclareDeals to support deal transfer: allow moving deals from sector to sector
* CapacityDeals: allow purchasing a capacity of the storage of a miner instead of the storage of a specific deal
* Update protocol that does not require to perform an operation on a full sector.
* DealUpdates: a license to terminate a deal in place for a new one (e.g. a user wants to update a portion of their files)
