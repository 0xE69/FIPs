## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the FIP.-->

To provide more flexibilities for Filecoin finance market, a new role *beneficiary* is proposed for a storage provider, which takes over the financial control from the owner.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

There are different roles for a storage provide node for differennt specific purpose, including a worker and optional multiple controllers for mining/market and PoRep/PoSt message handling. At the same time, a node is owned by the role owner which has full control of the node, including finance. 

The beneficiary role is to take financial control from owner, i.e. only financiary role could withdraw filecoin from a storage provider node, and the owner keep other controls.

## Change Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for FIPs that want to change the Filecoin protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the FIP solves. FIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Filecoin's pledge collateral mechanism makes it a perfect lending market. We already see some projects launched to solve the problem, e.g. Coinlist is running lending business to Filecoin storage providers while asking excess pledge paid in other digital currency. However, the filecoin node itself has great value including pledge collateral and locked rewards, which, ideally, can be used as collateral for filecoin lending. DARMA project is trying to do this but asking the ownership transferred, which is also practical in some Filecoin service providers.

The problem is the owner of a Filecoin node has full control of the node, including changing worker and controllers, withdraw balance or terminate sectors. This proposal is to separate the node control and financial benefit into different roles, that's how the beneficiary comes in.


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Filecoin implementations. -->

The following channges apply to specs-actors module:

- Add **Beneficiary** address into **MinerInfo** structure
- The **Beneficiary** is set to the same address of **Owner** when initiating a miner without specifying a beneficiary address (for back-compatibility)
- The **Beneficiary** address could be a signaable address, or multisig address, or actor address (for smart contract)
- The **WithdrawBalance** method of a miner can only be called by the miner's **Beneficiary**

- *(TBD)* Add **SetBeneficiaryExpiration** method to miner actor to propose or connfirm the expiration of a beneficiary. When a beneficiary expired, the owner could take it back directly. There are 2 steps for this setting. 0 setting means no expiration setting
    - The benneficiary/owner propose an expiration height
    - The owner/beneficiary confirm the expiration height

- *(TBC)* Add **SetBeneficiaryQuota** method to miner actor to propose or connfirm the expiration of a beneficiary. A beneficiary can only withdraw balance up to the quota. When the quota is met, the owner could take it back directly. There are 2 steps for this setting. 0 setting means no quota setting.
    - The benneficiary/owner propose a beneficial quota
    - The owner/beneficiary confirm the beneficial quota

- Add **ChangeBeneficiaryAddress** method to miner actor to propose or confirm a change of beneficiary address. The owner can change the beneficiary if the current beneficiary is expired or the quota is used up, otherwise, there are 3 steps to go: 
    - The current beneficiary address propose a change using the new beneficiary address as the parameter
    - The owner address confirm the change by sending the same message
    - The new beneficiary address accept the change by sending the same message

Some related API changes are required for all the Filecoin implementations, e.g. miner information query, beneficiary status query (expiration data, quota, current status etc.) 

Related command lines are better to provided in Filecoin implementations. This part can be designed by the implementation maintanancers.



## Design Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Mainly there are two scenarios for the beneficiary address being separated from owner address based on the current design.

1. Enable lending market using the node rewards as collateral. This is actually done by some Filecoin network service providers, but, currently, it only works when the lender is the service provider. When we have the beneficiary address, the lender could be anybody else who value the node itself.
2. For storage provider internal use, there are lots of advantages when having a separated beneficiary address, which can be controlled by the finance department, while owner be controller by the maintenance/engineering team.

But, there are more use cases can be developed when this is in place. E.g.

- Block Reward pooling design: Rewarding sharing is a very good thing for small/medium storage providers since it can provide much more certainty of income. Almost in all mining pool design, the small/medium miners need to hand over the beneficiary address to the pool provider. In Filecoin, Owner address need to be transferred if there is no another beneficiary address, which is too risky, since owner has fully control of the node. A separated beneficiary address makes it much safer.
- Reward pooling can be integrated with Smart Contract when it is available, in this case, the beneficiary address could be transferred to an trustless actor. We can not transfer the owner to a smart contract address, since it is hard to change it back. But we can do it with beneficiary address with a good design.

In addition, if we have the security feature, it will protest the storage provider from the beneficiary owner mistake (loss or expose of private key), or any other risks, e.g. bankruptcy, to some degree.


## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All FIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The FIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. FIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

This FIP changes actors behavior so it requires a new filecoin network version.

From functionalities point of view, since the owner is also the beneficiary by default, it is fully backwards compatible.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for FIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other FIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

This proposal has no consensus changes, there should be no impact for chain sync and block generation logic.
* Default beneficiary is the owner
* The expiration and quota criteria set and work well
* Beneficiary change logic works fine
* Beneficiary support signable, multisig and actor address (this might be test later when FVM is in place)


## Security Considerations

This FIP does not touch consensus, block generation.

There is a concern that the beneficiary address might be controlled by people who are not so familiar with Filecoin, which may lead to some mistake of private key loss. Basically this can not be really handled well. In addition, the expiration date and quota setting is for kind of pretectioins.


## Incentive Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the incentive implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for incentive discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will incentivize reliable and useful storage is required. FIP submissions missing the "Incentive Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Incentive Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

There is no change to incentives.


## Product Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the product implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for product discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will enable better storage-related goods and services to be developed on Filecoin. FIP submissions missing the "Product Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Product Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

The implementation of separating beneficiary from owner will bring the ecosystem more flexibilities, including the lending market and the finance management. The lending market could be centralized, e.g. by institutional capitals, or decentralized by smart contracts. When the FVM is available and the user defined actors is possible, there could be differnt finance agreements for user to choose. The most important thing is, all filecoin hodlers could join to get interest by staking.
